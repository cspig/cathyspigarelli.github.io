Cathy Spigarelli is an experienced Environmental Health and Safety professional currently working as a Corporate EHS and Product Stewardship Manager. With a Bachelor of Science degree in Metallurgical Engineering (Material Science) and two Master of Science degrees (Pharmacology & Toxicology and EHS with a specialty in Environmental Management), she puts this knowledge to use at a highly technical chemical company.  

Cathy’s experience has been gained through working in a number of industries (computer hardware, commercial battery, specialty paper, pulp, paper converting, and microencapsulation) with roles in manufacturing, R&D, and customer technical support.   

Life as a Mommy: Insights, Advice, and Ponderings of a Typical Mom was written by Cathy while raising three children. She wrote every day for an entire year while her kids were 2,4, and 6 years old. The relationship tools and parenting principles needed as a parent are certainly transferrable to other relationships.  Cathy has applied the interpersonal and relationship skills she researched, learned and practiced while being a mom to the work environment in interesting and effective ways.

Cathy is now interested in sharing EHS “insights, advice, and ponderings” and hopes that you enjoy the content of this blog.
